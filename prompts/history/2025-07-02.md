# 2025-07-02 — Session Summary

## Major Activities
- Updated the security_analyst agent to use Gemma3 with Ollama (local), confirmed via config and live API test.
- Restarted the server, resolved port conflicts, and verified agent initialization and LLM registration in logs.
- Successfully tested the security_analyst agent with a prompt, confirming Gemma3 is working.
- Committed and pushed all changes to the main branch, including a new version tag (v1.2.0) for multi-LLM provider support.
- Created and ran a comprehensive, robust test suite (`test_suite.py`) to validate environment, config, DB, LLMs, API, agent endpoints, code review, and memory system.

## User Prompts / Requests
- User requested that the API be able to handle multiple LLM models/providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) with abstraction.
- User provided API keys for all LLM providers and confirmed Ollama is running locally.
- User requested to switch the security_analyst agent to use Gemma3 via Ollama.
- User asked to kill processes on port 8000 and restart the server as needed.
- User requested to push all changes to main in GitHub and tag the milestone.
- User asked for a robust, verbose test suite to ensure all components are working and to highlight any missing setup.
- User requested a daily project history file, prefixed with the date, summarizing all major activities and next steps.
- User asked to include the actual prompts/requests in the daily history for better traceability.

## Issues Detected by Test Suite
- Claude model not found (404 error) — check available models for your API key/region.
- Gemini API quota exceeded (429 error) — check Google Gemini API quota/billing.
- Agent memory summary for code_reviewer timed out — possible endpoint or DB issue.
- MemoryManager.store_memory() called with wrong arguments in test — needs signature fix.
- Minor config test bug (attribute access vs dict).

## Fixes/Improvements Made
- Fixed config import in test suite to use `get_config()`.
- Ensured all required files, environment variables, and DB tables are present.
- Confirmed OpenAI and Ollama (Gemma3) LLMs are working.
- All agents respond to `generate_response` and `code_review` tasks.

## Next Steps (for tomorrow)
- Fix test suite bugs (config access, memory manager signature, endpoint timeout).
- Address LLM provider issues (Claude model, Gemini quota).
- Rerun test suite for full green status.
